Required for alpha 4
--------------------

 - Implement READ [SAVE|RESTORE]
 - Syntax highlighting of decimals with no leading zero


Required for alpha 5
--------------------

 - Don't fake/support drive specifications, e.g. A:/
 - Implement tab completion of paths at MMBasic prompt
 - Implement variable/sub/function hash tables
 - Replace bang ! command with *, or allow both ?
 - Implement SAVE command (?)
 - Make sense of or eliminate mmb_options.prog_flash_size


Required for alpha 6
--------------------

Reorder interrupt processing to match PicoMite, add this as a comment to the
code:
  1. ON KEY individual
  2. ON KEY general
  -- 3. GUI Int Down (not PicoMiteVGA)
  -- 4. GUI Int Up (not PicoMiteVGA)
  -- 5. ADC completion
  -- 6. I2C Slave Rx
  -- 7. I2C Slave Tx
  -- 8. I2C2 Slave Rx
  -- 9. I2C2 Slave Tx
  -- 10. WAV Finished
  11. COM1: Serial Port
  12. COM2: Serial Port
  -- 13. IR Receive
  -- 14. Keypad
  -- 15. Interrupt command/CSub Interrupt
  -- 16. I/O Pin Interrupts in order of definition
  17. Tick Interrupts (1 to 4 in that order)
Consider options for handling of control characters in MMgetline()
Read from serial ports directly into RxBuf
  - i.e. not via a temporary buffer
Buffer serial port writes
Long running commands (AUTOSAVE, XMODEM) should call background processing
Perform background processing in different thread
Implement LOAD FONT and DEFINEFONT
Tidy up LED snake example
Implement CONSOLE BLINK, BOLD, FAINT, ITALIC, REVERSE, STRIKE, UNDERLINE


Required for alpha 7
--------------------

Write a proper lexer and ensure all Peter's "preprocessor tricks" work in both
  - programs, and
  - the command-line
Completely overhaul 'mmbasic.syntax.nanorc'
  - can we fix syntax highlighting for "strings" inside comments ?


Required for release
--------------------

Add option to PAUSE controlling whether it nanosleeps or not
 - or an OPTION to MMBasic controlling all sleep behaviour
Make output from LS more like that of CMM2
Have another look at the other settings recommended for raw console mode
Work through CMM2 manual implementing missing commands/functions
Review all uses of void*
Implement safety checks on PEEK/POKE calls
 - should these be optional ?
 - should address alignment of PEEK/POKE be optional ?



To infinity and beyond
----------------------

Implement FORK, WAIT and friends
Build on macOS
Extend preprocessor
Implement SWAP
Integrate 'pigpio' with Raspberry Pi build
High resolution graphics
Fix bug where TRACE will not log a line that you GOTO/GOSUB using a line number,
  but will if you use a label
Can PRINT @(x,y) be implemented without using a function slot for @ ?
Implement line continuation character _
What should behaviour be when a command at the MMBasic prompt goes onto a second line ?


EDITOR issues
-------------

File numbers, e.g. #5 should be highlighted in green
Should Ctrl-K delete to the end of the line instead of the entire line ?

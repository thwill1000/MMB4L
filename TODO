TODO
====

Required for 0.6
----------------

 - Add ability to direct TRACE to a file
 - Add ability to call native "C" shared objects


Required for 0.7
----------------

 - Support "long lines" at the MMBasic prompt
 - Add PicoMite EDITor implementation
   - and add support for "long lines" to it
 - Add '.' command that behaves like a combination of '*' and '!', first
   looking for a .bas file to run and then trying a SYSTEM command.
 - Don't include line number and filename in error message string; still show
   them at prompt where appropriate and make them available via MM.INFO()
 - Make default output from FILES more like that of CMM2
 - Fix TODOs in 'path.c'
 - (?) Implement SAVE command
 - (?) Don't fake/support drive specifications, e.g. A:/
 - (?) Remove use of 'goto' in 'path.c'
 - (?) Remove SETTITLE and CURSOR commands
 - (?) Rewrite 'tools/glibc_check.sh' in MMBasic
 - Find fix for this bug:

    ' This will sometimes run forever,
    ' and occasionally do nothing because the interrupt never fires.

    Option Console Both
    Option Base 0
    Option Default None
    Option Explicit Off

    Timer = 0

    SetTick 5, my_interrupt
    Pause 10
    End

    Sub my_interrupt()
      ? "Interrupt entered"
      Print Timer
      Local i%
      For i% = 1 To 100000 : Next
      ? "Interrupt exited"
    End Sub


Required for 0.8
----------------

 - Remove 32K array size limit.
 - Reorder interrupt processing to match PicoMite, add this as a comment to the
   code:
      1. ON KEY individual
      2. ON KEY general
   -- 3. GUI Int Down (not PicoMiteVGA)
   -- 4. GUI Int Up (not PicoMiteVGA)
   -- 5. ADC completion
   -- 6. I2C Slave Rx
   -- 7. I2C Slave Tx
   -- 8. I2C2 Slave Rx
   -- 9. I2C2 Slave Tx
   -- 10. WAV Finished
      11. COM1: Serial Port
      12. COM2: Serial Port
   -- 13. IR Receive
   -- 14. Keypad
   -- 15. Interrupt command/CSub Interrupt
   -- 16. I/O Pin Interrupts in order of definition
      17. Tick Interrupts (1 to 4 in that order)
  - Consider options for handling of control characters in MMgetline()
  - Read from serial ports directly into RxBuf
    - i.e. not via a temporary buffer
  - Buffer serial port writes
  - Long running commands (AUTOSAVE, XMODEM) should call background processing
  - Perform background processing in different thread
  - Implement LOAD FONT and DEFINEFONT
  - Tidy up LED snake example
  - Implement CONSOLE BLINK, BOLD, FAINT, ITALIC, REVERSE, STRIKE, UNDERLINE


Required for 0.9
----------------

  - Write a proper lexer and ensure all Peter's "preprocessor tricks" work in both
    - programs, and
    - the command-line
  - Completely overhaul 'mmbasic.syntax.nanorc'
    - can we fix syntax highlighting for "strings" inside comments ?


Required for 1.0
----------------

  - Add option to PAUSE controlling whether it nanosleeps or not
    - or an OPTION to MMBasic controlling all sleep behaviour
  - Have another look at the other settings recommended for raw console mode
  - Work through other MMBasic manuals implementing missing commands/functions
  - Review all uses of void*
  - Implement safety checks on PEEK/POKE calls
    - should these be optional ?
    - should address alignment of PEEK/POKE be optional ?


To infinity and beyond
----------------------

  - Implement FORK, WAIT and friends
  - Build on macOS
  - Extend preprocessor
  - Implement SWAP
  - Integrate 'pigpio' with Raspberry Pi build
  - High resolution graphics
  - Fix bug where TRACE will not log a line that you GOTO/GOSUB using a line number,
    but will if you use a label
  - Can PRINT @(x,y) be implemented without using a function slot for @ ?
  - Implement line continuation character _
  - Implement exception handling TRY | CATCH | FINALLY | END TRY

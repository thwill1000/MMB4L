MMBasic for Linux (MMB4L)
=========================

As a whole MMB4L is covered by a modified 4-clause BSD license,
see LICENSE.MMBasic.

Most unit-tests, integration-tests, examples and some utility code are
dual-licensed with the MIT License, see LICENSE.MIT. Such source files can be
identified by their file header comments.

Individual source files may contain other attributions and license variations,
none of which *are believed to* impact the overall statement presented in
LICENSE.MMBasic.

Note that MMB4L is derived from other MMBasic versions that are:

  Copyright 2011-2025 Geoff Graham
  Copyright 2016-2025 Peter Mather

Historically these versions were available only under a more restrictive
non-"open source" license but with Geoff and Peter's kind permission
MMBasic has been relicensed for MMB4L and also for these recent versions
maintained by Peter Mather:

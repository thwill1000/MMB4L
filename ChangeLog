ChangeLog
---------

Version 2021.01.00-a2 - 6-Nov-2021:
  - Added ability to specify at the Linux shell a BASIC program that MMB4L
    should RUN when it starts, e.g.
        ./mmbasic myprogram.bas arg1 arg2 arg3
    see README for details.
  - Added optional integer argument (default 0) to END and QUIT that can be
    used to return an exit code to the Linux shell, see README for details.
  - Added SETTICK command from the CMM2:
    - SETTICK FAST is not supported.
    - Be aware that Since Linux is not a Real Time Operating System all timing
      commands such as PAUSE and SETTICK are subject to more error and variation
      than on the microcontroller MMBasic implementations.
  - Added JSON$() function from the CMM2:
    - MMB4L adds an optional 3rd parameter which is a 2 bit argument controlling
      how explicit nulls and missing values are handled in the JSON:
        - &b00 : return empty strings for both.
        - &b01 : return "<null>" for explicit null.
        - &b10 : return "<missing>" for missing value.
        - &b11 : return both "<null>" and "<missing>".
  - Added DAY$(), DATETIME$() and EPOCH() functions from the CMM2:
    - note that unlike DATE$ and TIME$ the DATETIME$(NOW) function will return
      the date & time in UTC, not in the local timezone.
  - Added missing MEMORY, PEEK and POKE sub-commands.
    Now implements the same as the CMM2 (5.07.01) with the exception of the
    undocumented/legacy:
        PEEK(hiaddr, loaddr)
        POKE hiaddr, loaddr, byte
    And with the addition of:
        MEMORY COPY BYTE src, dst, number_of_bytes
          - which is equivalent to MEMORY COPY src, dst, number_of_bytes
        MEMORY COPY SHORT src, dst, number_of_shorts
        MEMORY COPY WORD src, dst, number_of_words
  - Added optional integer array parameter to SYSTEM command to allow any
    standard output generated to be captured in a LONGSTRING, e.g.
        DIM out%(100)
        SYSTEM "ls", out%()
        LONGSTRING PRINT out%()
  - Added support for prefixing paths with '~' which is expanded to the
    users home directory (the value of the HOME environment variable).
  - Added optional integer argument (default 1) to ERROR command allowing an
    error code to be specified, this can be retrieved using MM.ERRNO, e.g.
        ERROR "error message", 220
    For MMB4L the values of MM.ERRNO are:
      - 0        : no error.
      - 1        : unclassified MMBasic error, also reported if a C library call
                   reports the error EPERM (Operation not permitted).
                   Note this differs from other versions of MMBasic which use
                   the value of 16 for general errors, this would correspond to
                   the EBUSY (Device or resource busy) error from a C library
                   call.
      - 2..150   : standard error numbers (errno) for C library calls.
      - 151..200 : reserved for future classification of MMBasic errors.
      - 201..255 : suggested range for program specific error codes.
      - error codes from the SYSTEM command are an exception to this rule,
        see the next entry.
  - Changed SYSTEM command to set MM.ERRNO equal to the executed program's
    exit code. Also changed error message to include this value.
  - Changed CONSOLE SETCURSOR command to allow a maximum x, y of 1023
    (previously 255) and updated "examples/mandelbrot.bas" to support this.
  - Changed "mmbasic.nanorc" to make behaviour more like the CMM2 editor:
      - added 'set constantshow' so the cursor position display is always
        visible.
      - added 'set zap' so that [Delete] and [Backspace] erase all the selected
        text instead of just a single character.
      - either of these can be commented out with # if you prefer.
  - Fixed issues with "mmbasic.syntax.nanorc":
      - command keywords always highlighted, not just when they are the first
        token on a line.
      - hexadecimal and binary constants highlighted as numbers (green).
      - comments correctly highlighted following string constants containing
        apostrophes.
      - highlighting of additional keywords.
  - Fixed timeout bugs with CONSOLE GETCURSOR:
      - increase the timeout to 10s.
      - correct the signed 64-bit arithmetic used in timing code.
  - Fixed bug where navigating the command prompt history with up/down arrow
    keys would show display artifacts when using PuTTY; though not sure why
    the issue was not generally visible.
  - Many other fixes and tweaks for minor issues encountered along the way.

Version 2021.01.00-a1 - 23-Sep-2021:
  - First alpha version.

---------

Version 2021.01.00-a2 - ??-???-2021:
 - Changed error handling so that the value of MM.ERRNO for most MMBasic
   errors is 1000, not 16. For MMB4L values are such that:
    - 0      : no error
    - 1-999  : standard error code from a C system/library call
               (16 happens to be "Device or resource busy" on Ubuntu 20.)
    - 1000+  : MMBasic specific errors
    - error numbers from the SYSTEM command are an exception to this rule,
      see the next entry.
 - Changed SYSTEM command to set MM.ERRNO equal to the executed program's
   exit code. Also changed error message to include this value.
 - Changed "mmbasic.nanorc" to make behaviour more like the CMM2 editor:
    - added 'set constantshow' so the cursor position display is always visible.
    - added 'set zap' so that [Delete] and [Backspace] erase all the selected
      text instead of just a single character.
    - either of these can be commented out with # if you prefer.

Version 2021.01.00-a1 - 23-Sep-2021:
 - First alpha version.
